   Release 0.65

   Important additions to HTML::Element :

     Totally reimplemented the traverse() method, and added features,
     now providing a somewhat-new interface.  It's still
     backwards-compatible both syntactically and semantically.
     
     Added methods: content_list, detach_content, replace_linkage,
     normalize_content, preinsert, postinsert, and has_insane_linkage.

     $h->attr('foo', undef) now actually deletes the attribute
     'foo' from $h, instead of setting it to undef.  Hopefully
     this won't break any existing code!

   Rearranged the order of some sections in the Element docs
   for purely pedagogical reasons.

   Bugfix:  $tree->clone failed to delete the internal
   _head and _body attributes of the clone (used by TreeBuilder),
   $tree->clone->delete ended up deleting most/all of the original!
   Fixed.  Added cavets to the docs warning against cloning
   TreeBuilder objects that are in mid-parse (not that I think most
   users are exactly rushing to do this).
   Thanks to Bob Glickstein for finding and reporting this bug.

   Added some regression/sanity tests in t/

   A bit more sanity checking in TreeBuilder: checks for _head and
   _body before including it.

   Modded TreeBuilder's calls to traverse() to be use new [sub{...},0]
   calling syntax, for sake of efficiency.

   Added some undocumented and experimental code in Element and
   TreeBuilder for using HTML::Element objects to represent
   comments, PIs, declarations, and "literals".

   Release 0.64

   Bugfix:  $element->replace_with_content() would cause
   a fatal error if any of $element's content nodes were
   text segments.  Fixed.

   Release 0.63

   Fixed a typo in the SYNOPSIS of TreeBuilder.pm: I had "->destroy" for
   "->delete"!

   Added $element->clone and HTML::Element->clone_list(nodes) methods,
   as Marek Rouchal very helpfully suggested.

   $tree->as_HTML can now indent, hopefully properly.  The logic to do
   so is pretty frightening, and regrettably doesn't wrap, and it's
   not obvious how to make it capable of doing so.

   $tree->as_text can now take a 'skip_dels' parameter.

   Added $h->same_as($j) method.

   Added $h->all_attr method.

   Added $h->new_from_lol constructor method.


1999-12-18   Sean M. Burke <sburke@netadventure.net>

   Release 0.62

   Incremented HTML::AsSubs version to 1.13, and HTML::Parse version
   to 2.7, to avoid version confusion with the old (<0.60) HTML-Tree
   dist.

   Re-simplified the options to HTML::Element::traverse, removing the
   verbose_for_text option.  (The behavior that it turned on, is now
   always on; this should not cause any problems with any existing
   code.)

   Fixed HTML::Element::delete_content, and made an
   HTML::TreeBuilder::delete to override it for TreeBuilder nodes,
   which have their own special attributes.  

   HTML::Element::find_by_attribute, find_by_attribute, and get_attr_i
   now behave differently in scalar context, if you're the sort that
   likes context on method calls.  HTML::Element::descendant is now
   optimized in scalar context.

   Fixed up some of the reporting of lineages in some $Debug-triggered
   messages.

   Fixed minor bug in updating pos when a text node under HTML
   implicates BODY (and maybe P).

   You should not use release 0.61

   Release 0.61

   Versions in this dist:
    HTML::Parse:  2.6
    HTML::TreeBuilder: 2.91
    HTML::Element:  1.44
    HTML::AsSubs: 1.12

   No longer including the Formatter modules.

   Lots of new methods and changes in HTML::Element; reorganized docs.

   Added new HTML tags to HTML::Element's and HTML::TreeBuilder's
   internal tables.

   Reworked the logic in HTML::TreeBuilder.  Previous versions dealt
   badly with tables, and attempts to enforce content-model rules
   occasionally went quite awry.  This new version is much less
   agressive about content-model rules, and works on the principle
   that if the HTML source is cock-eyed, there's limits to what can be
   done to keep the syntax tree from being cock-eyed.

   HTML::TreeBuilder now also tries to ignore ignorable whitespace.
   The resulting parse trees often have half (or fewer) the number of
   nodes, without all the ignorable "     " nodes like before.
