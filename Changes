1999-12-15   Sean M. Burke <sburke@netadventure.net>

   Release 0.61

   Versions in this dist:
    HTML::Parse:  2.6
    HTML::TreeBuilder: 2.91
    HTML::Element:  1.44
    HTML::AsSubs: 1.12

   No longer including the Formatter modules.

   Lots of new methods and changes in HTML::Element; reorganized docs.

   Added new HTML tags to HTML::Element's and HTML::TreeBuilder's
   internal tables.

   Reworked the logic in HTML::TreeBuilder.  Previous versions dealt
   badly with tables, and attempts to enforce content-model rules
   occasionally went quite awry.  This new version is much less
   agressive about content-model rules, and works on the principle
   that if the HTML source is cock-eyed, there's limits to what can be
   done to keep the syntax tree from being cock-eyed.

   HTML::TreeBuilder now also tries to ignore ignorable whitespace.
   The resulting parse trees often have half (or fewer) the number of
   nodes, without all the ignorable "     " nodes like before.
