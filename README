HTML-Tree
---------

This is a collection of modules that represent, create, and extract
information from HTML syntax trees.  These modules used to be part of
the libwww-perl distribution, but are now unbundled in order to
facilitate a separate development track.  Bug reports and discussions
about these modules can still be sent to the <libwww@perl.org> mailing
list, or to <sburke@cpan.org>.

The modules present in this collection are:

  HTML::Tree -- overview of the modules.

  HTML::Element - represents the nodes of the HTML syntax trees.  The
        elements have other elements and text segments as children.
        The HTML::Element class have methods to methods to build,
        alter, and traverse the structure of the tree.

  HTML::TreeBuilder - uses HTML::Parser to read HTML document text and
        build from it a syntax tree made of HTML::Element nodes.

  HTML::Parse - deprecated.  Now just a wrapper around
        HTML::TreeBuilder

  HTML::AsSubs - Easy way to build an HTML syntax tree by nesting
        functions.
